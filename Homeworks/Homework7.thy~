  (********** PART 1 ***************)

  (*
    In this homework, we will develop a faster way to interpret programs.
  
    First, we want to define a functional version of a small step,
    that is, a function 
      small_stepf :: com * state \<Rightarrow> (com * state) option
    that returns the next configuration, after performing one small step.
    If the configuration was final, it shall return None.
    The equations of this function correspond to the rules of SmallStep.
    
    Complete the function!
  *)



  (* Hint: Ignore *warnings* about ambiguous inputs ... the \<Rightarrow> in case and big-step causes them.
    If you get type *errors*, though, DO NOT IGNORE THEM!
  *)

  fun small_stepf :: "com * state \<Rightarrow> (com * state) option" where
    "small_stepf (x ::= a, s) = Some (SKIP, s(x := aval a s))"

  (* 
    Write a function iterate that iterates small_stepf, until a final 
    configuration is reached, but for at most n iterations.
    
    If no final configuration is reached after n iterations, the function 
    shall return None. 
    
    Hint: For n=0, it is OK to always return None, even if the configuration should be final.
      This will simplify the equation for 0.
  
    n is also called fuel: Each iteration uses one unit of fuel, 
      and when running out of fuel the computation stops.
      
    Do not use \<rightarrow> or final in your function, but 
    use small_stepsf instead (cf. thms small_stepf_eq and final_eq)!

  (*
    The iterate function gives you another way to execute programs, which 
    is considerably faster than constructing derivation trees.
    
    Notes: 
      * the extracts the value cs from Some cs, and the None is undefined.
      * snd extracts the second component of a pair
      * If you do not specify enough initial fuel, the command will just return 
        \<open>snd (the None) ''a''\<close>, otherwise it returns teh correct result, e.g., 225.
        Specifying too much fuel, on the other hand, is no problem, as the iteration 
        stops once it reaches a final result, not necessarily using up all its fuel.
