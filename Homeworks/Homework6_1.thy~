section \<open>Quotient, Rounded Down\<close>
  
(* Write a program that returns the quotient, rounded down, of two positive 
  numbers x and y, in variable q.
  
  Note: Due to the limited operations available, in particular no Minus,
    finding the simplest program may require a little thought. You may need an auxiliary variable.
  Hint: You only need a single WHILE loop, and no IF.
  Hint: It might be a good idea to sketch the program in pseudocode or C first,
    before you write it down in IMP syntax.
